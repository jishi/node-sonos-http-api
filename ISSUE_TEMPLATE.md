## Before you submit an issue

Search among the current open _and_ closed issues for an answer to your question before submitting an issue!

If your question is Docker related, please file the issue at the https://github.com/chrisns/docker-node-sonos-http-api and also, make sure you have tested that image before asking a question. This is the only image that has any correlation to this project, and is guaranteed to be up to date.

If your question has anything to do with Amazon Echo, it is probably better suited at https://github.com/rgraciano/echo-sonos. If you have questions about the requests sent to this library, figure out the exact request that is sent from the Alexa Skill (through the logs) and include that in the issue.

Thank you!
